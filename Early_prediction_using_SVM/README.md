# Deep Learning with Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) and SVM

## Description

This repository contains an implementation of a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification purposes. Random data samples are used to demonstrate the workflow where SSAE is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data, followed by training an SVM model on the encoded features.

## Dependencies

- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scipy
- Keras
- Scikit-learn

## Code Excution

1. Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed.
2. Execute the given Python code.
3. The script will start by creating random data samples for both source and target features.
4. It will then construct and train an SSAE model.
5. Encoded features will be obtained using the encoder part of the SSAE.
6. SVM will be trained on the encoded features from the target domain.
7. Finally, the performance metrics of the SVM model will be printed.

## Features

- Uses a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
- Employs an SVM model for classification after dimensionality reduction.
- Demonstrates the use of Keras for building and training the SSAE.
- Provides metrics like test accuracy for evaluation.
- Random data samples are used for the demonstration, but it can be replaced with actual data for practical use.

## Note

- Adjust hyperparameters like number of epochs, batch size, and others as required.
- To use actual data, replace the random data generation part with proper data loading mechanisms.
